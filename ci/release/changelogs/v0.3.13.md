#### Features 🚀

#### Improvements 🧹

- Containers expand to fit long child labels
- Edge labels on cluster edges are placed along the edges more symmetrically
- More symmetrical placements are found for shapes connected to multiple other shapes
- More aligned layouts in graphs where multiple shapes in a container are connected to a shape at the parent level
- Connections between two shapes of different container levels take the direction of the least nested shape
- Connections made across grid diagrams and sequence diagrams are now routed with TALA's edge routing
- Improves edge routing to allow more bidirectional edges to overlap when they share a node and have matching arrowheads
- Less memory used when many subgraphs

#### Bugfixes ⛑️

- Fixes overlapping routes for certain trees with mixed arrow directions
- Label for the first step of multiple connected steps with "multiple" set is centered
- Connections to concave shapes like "step" are more precisely connected when multiple or 3d set (previously they jutted into the shape a little)
- Prevents edge case where a connection with a long connection label could overlap shapes
- Fixes an edge case where two connected nodes in different containers were suboptimally aligned
