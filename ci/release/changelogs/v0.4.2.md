#### Features 🚀

- `tala-seeds` can be specified in the source code through `vars` (see manual for more)

#### Improvements 🧹

- Containers expand to fit large labels
- Edge labels are placed more intelligently to avoid overlaps
- Nodes with multiple edges to another node with long edge labels are positioned more intelligently
- Two nodes with > 2 edges with labels strongly prefer being in horizontal orientation to each other. This increases the chance of their multiple edge labels being readable.
- Hierarchies with multiple parents are more centered
- Up to 20% faster

#### Bugfixes ⛑️

- Fixed rare panic when hierarchies with containers were used
- Various edge cases that affect layout have been fixed
- Fixes rare panic with multiple edges with arrowhead labels on the same table column
- Fixes rare panic using step shapes connected to other shapes
