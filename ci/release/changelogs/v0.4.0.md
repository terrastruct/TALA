TALA 0.4.0 is a massive improvement in layout positions of a wide range of diagrams.

#### Improvements üßπ

- Unconnected nodes and subgraphs are packed more tightly together
- Containers of similar sizes with indirect connections are aligned better
- Some diagrams escape local minimas better
- Nodes connected on both sides are more equidistant to both
- Cluster edge labels prioritize not intersecting with other cluster edges
- Node labels reposition to avoid overlapping with icons
- Node icons reposition to avoid overlapping with fixed labels
- Multiple edges between nodes are now ordered (left-right and top-down) by the order they were declared
- Edge routes between grid cells avoid node labels
- Edge routes consider paths that go through "invisible" nodes and edges (e.g. zero opacity)
- When only one of `width` or `height` is specified for a container, nodes will full up better to reduce unused space
- Tree structures are built more symmetrically
- Containers with edges going into its children are pulled closer together to the other edge endpoint
- Clusters of nodes are oriented more reasonably to facilitate better routes
- Clusters routes more often converge on a single point in the middle to form the "fork" aesthetic
- Node labels are positioned in areas of more space
- Edge labels avoid fixed node icon positions

#### Bugfixes ‚õëÔ∏è

- Fixes extra warnings that appeared with an invalid token
- Fixes panic when edges were defined between actors in different sequence diagrams
- Fixes custom label positions and icon positions not working for nodes in tree structures
- Disallow edges with different styles (e.g. stroke colors) from sharing routes
- Some direct straight routes weren't being considered between two non-diagonal nodes
