#### Features 🚀

- `tala-seeds` can be specified in the source code through `vars` (see manual for more)

#### Improvements 🧹

- ~15% speedup on most large diagrams
- Less crossings between edges connecting table columns
- Edges route to diamond shape corners more strictly
- For manual positions that completely block all paths (e.g. two shapes manually positioned on top of each other), TALA will route edges with a straight line rather than giving up on the layout
- Slightly decrease distance between hierarchy nodes
- Bin packing algorithm improved to fit subgraphs better
- Circle containers fit much better (centered and padding reduced)
- Reduced padding for containers with icon/label mix

#### Bugfixes ⛑️

- Fixes edge case where a vertical/horizontal edge route completely overlapped another
- A common case of cross-container hierarchies appropriately use hierarchy layout
- Fixes edge case where nodes could be placed in between an edge of another subgraph
- Fixes edge case where edge could become disconnected from endpoints when many subgraphs
- Fixes edge case where edges between grids become disconnected
